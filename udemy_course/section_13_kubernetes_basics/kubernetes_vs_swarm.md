# Kubernetes and Swarm

- Both are orchestration solutions that can run anywhere (onpremise, cloud).
- Swarm is a builtin orchestration solution.

- Kubernetes has many [vendor distributions](https://kubernetes.io/partners/#conformance) like Rancher, openshift, VMWare PKS etc.

- Vendor distributions add various options for networking, security, storage etc.

## Kubernetes vs Swarm

- Both are container orchestration tools that run on top of container runtime.
- [Container runtimes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/setup/production-environment/container-runtimes/) like docker, containerd, CRI-O etc
- Swarm is easy to install, setup, deploy and manage.
- Kubernetes has more flexibility and features, customization, wider adoption and support.

### Swarm

- Comes from Docker.
- Easy to deploy and manage(smaller team is sufficient).
- Runs where docker container can run(runs on windows out of the box).
- Secure by default
- Easier to troubleshoot

### Kubernetes

- Native cloud service support to deploy/manage Kubernetes
- Flexible - widest set of use cases.
- Wider adoption and community support.
